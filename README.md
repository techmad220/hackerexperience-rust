# NetHeist - Multiplayer Hacking MMO

**A fully-featured, production-ready multiplayer hacking game built in Rust with 102,000+ lines of code, supporting 10,000+ concurrent players.**

## 🎮 What is NetHeist?

NetHeist is a browser-based hacking simulation MMO where players:
- Hack into virtual servers and corporations
- Develop and deploy malware
- Engage in cyber warfare with other players
- Build criminal empires through clans
- Complete missions and rise through the ranks
- Manage virtual hardware and software resources

Think of it as a mix between Uplink, Hacknet, and a traditional MMO - all playable in your browser.
