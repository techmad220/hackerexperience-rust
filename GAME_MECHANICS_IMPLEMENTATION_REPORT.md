## üßÆ Mathematical Formulas Implemented

### Core Formula Library

The implementation includes a comprehensive formula library with mathematically accurate calculations:

#### Success Probability Calculation
```rust
P(success) = base_rate √ó (1 + skill_bonus) √ó difficulty_modifier √ó equipment_bonus √ó luck_factor
```
- Skill bonus: `ln(skill_level / 100) / ln(2)` (logarithmic scaling)
- Difficulty modifier: `exp(-0.1 √ó difficulty)` (exponential decay)
- Equipment bonus: clamped between 0.0 and 2.0
- Final probability: clamped between 0.0 and 1.0

#### Experience Requirements
```rust
EXP(level) = base_exp √ó (level^scaling_factor) √ó difficulty_multiplier
```
- Default scaling factor: 1.1 (configurable)
- Overflow protection for high levels
- Level 0 special case handling

#### Process Time Calculation
```rust
Time = base_time √ó complexity / (resource_efficiency + 1)
```
- CPU efficiency: `ln(cpu_power / 100) + 1`
- RAM efficiency: `sqrt(ram_available / 1000)`
- Total efficiency: `cpu_efficiency √ó ram_efficiency √ó optimization_level`
- Minimum time: 1 second guaranteed

#### Combat Damage Formula
```rust
Damage = base_damage √ó (attacker_skill / defender_skill) √ó equipment_ratio √ó random_variance
```
- Skill ratio: `(attacker_skill + 1) / (defender_skill + 1)` (prevents division by zero)
- Equipment ratio: `attacker_equipment / max(defender_equipment, 0.1)`
- Random variance: typically 0.8 to 1.2 for ¬±20% variation

#### Compound Interest
```rust
Final = principal √ó (1 + rate)^periods
```
- Overflow protection for large calculations
- Support for negative rates (within bounds)
- Precision handling for financial calculations

#### Market Price Dynamics
```rust
Price = base_price √ó (demand / supply)^elasticity √ó volatility_factor
```
- Supply/demand validation (must be positive)
- Elasticity factor controls price sensitivity
- Volatility factor introduces market fluctuations
- Minimum price floor protection

#### Network Latency
```rust
Latency = base_latency + (distance √ó propagation_delay) + processing_delay
```
- Propagation delay: `distance_km / 200_000 km/s √ó 1000` (fiber optic speed)
- Infrastructure quality impact: `1 / max(quality, 0.1)`
- Congestion factor additive delay

#### Skill Progression with Diminishing Returns
```rust
Gain = base_gain √ó (1 - current_skill/max_skill)^diminishing_factor
```
- Prevents infinite skill growth
- Configurable diminishing factor (default: varies by system)
- Ensures meaningful progression at all levels

#### Clan Reputation
```rust
Reputation = base_rep + Œ£(contributions √ó weights) + war_bonus - penalties
```
- War bonus: `(victories √ó 10) - (defeats √ó 5)`
- Contribution weighting based on member rank
- Reputation floor at 0 (cannot go negative)

#### Resource Consumption
```rust
Usage = base_consumption √ó efficiency_factor √ó load_multiplier
```
- Load multiplier: `1 + (current_load / max_load)` (linear scaling)
- Efficiency factor reduces consumption
- Realistic resource modeling

#### Normal Distribution Probability
```rust
P(x) = (1 / (œÉ‚àö(2œÄ))) √ó e^(-(x-Œº)¬≤/(2œÉ¬≤))
```
- Standard normal distribution implementation
- Used for random event probability calculations
- Proper mathematical normalization

### Balance Validation

Mathematical validation of balance principles:

```rust
// Example: Validate diminishing returns in skill progression
for current_skill in 0..100 {
    let gain1 = calculate_skill_gain(current_skill, 100);
    let gain2 = calculate_skill_gain(current_skill + 1, 100);
    assert!(gain2 <= gain1, "Skill progression must have diminishing returns");
}

// Example: Validate no dominant hacking method
let methods = [BruteForce, Dictionary, SocialEngineering, Exploit];
for difficulty in [Easy, Medium, Hard] {
    let effectiveness: Vec<_> = methods.iter()
        .map(|method| calculate_method_effectiveness(method, difficulty))
        .collect();
    
    let max_effectiveness = effectiveness.iter().max();
    let min_effectiveness = effectiveness.iter().min();
    
    // No method should be more than 2x better than worst method
    assert!(max_effectiveness / min_effectiveness < 2.0);
}
```
