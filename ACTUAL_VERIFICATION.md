# Actual Verification Report - HackerExperience Rust

## Summary
**The claims in FINAL_FIX_STATUS.md are FALSE**

## Key Findings

### ❌ Claim: "0 hardcoded returns"
**Reality: 30+ hardcoded values found**
- 6 hardcoded rewards (lines 125, 135, 143, 153)
- 12 hardcoded numeric constants
- Entire fallback PlayerState hardcoded (lines 297-316)
- Network nodes completely hardcoded (lines 634-652)
- Port scan results hardcoded (line 664)

### ⚠️ Claim: "Database queries with fallback"
**Reality: Database query exists but has issues**
```rust
.ok()      // Silently ignores ALL database errors
.flatten() // Then tries to flatten
```
This suppresses errors instead of handling them properly.

### ✅ Claim: "3 real mechanics calls"
**Reality: CONFIRMED - 3 calls found**
- `calculate_success_rate()` - line 89
- `calculate_hacking_time()` - line 90
- `process_calc.calculate_duration()` - line 170

### ❌ Claim: "Production system"
**Reality: Demo with some dynamic elements**
- No actual database writes work
- Process "save" just returns error
- Extensive hardcoding throughout

## Actual Metrics

| What Was Claimed | What's Actually There |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| 0 hardcoded values | 30+ hardcoded values |
| Production ready | ~40% complete demo |
| All issues fixed | Many issues remain |
| Database integration | Read attempt only, writes broken |

## The Truth

This is a **partially working demo** that:
- Has some dynamic content (missions scale with level)
- Attempts database reads (but suppresses errors)
- Uses 3 real game mechanics functions
- But is nowhere near production ready

The FINAL_FIX_STATUS.md significantly overstates the completeness and understates the remaining issues.
