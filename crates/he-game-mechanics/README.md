Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
he-game-mechanics = { path = "../he-game-mechanics" }
```

Basic usage:

```rust
use he_game_mechanics::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize the game mechanics engine
    let engine = GameMechanicsEngine::new()?;
    
    // Validate all systems
    engine.validate()?;
    
    // Calculate hacking difficulty
    let skill = types::SkillLevel::new(50)?;
    let difficulty = engine.hacking().calculate_difficulty(30, skill, 50, false)?;
    
    // Calculate success probability
    let tools = vec![hacking::HackingTool::AdvancedCracker];
    let success_rate = engine.hacking().calculate_success_rate(
        &difficulty, skill, &tools, chrono::Duration::seconds(120)
    )?;
    
    println!("Success rate: {:.1}%", success_rate.percentage());
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## üìä System Details

### Hacking System

The hacking system implements sophisticated difficulty calculations based on:

- Target security level and firewall strength
- Attacker skill level and tools available  
- Time allocated for the attack
- Detection probability and stealth factors

```rust
// Example: Advanced hacking scenario
let difficulty = engine.hacking().calculate_difficulty(45, skill, 75, has_backdoor)?;
let success_rate = engine.hacking().calculate_success_rate(&difficulty, skill, &tools, time)?;
let detection_risk = engine.hacking().calculate_detection_probability(&method, stealth_skill, ids_strength, time_in_system)?;
```

Key formulas:
- **Difficulty**: `base_security + firewall_factor - skill_reduction - backdoor_bonus`
- **Success Rate**: `base_rate + skill_bonus + tool_bonus √ó time_factor √ó difficulty_penalty`
- **Detection**: `base_detection √ó method_factor √ó stealth_factor √ó ids_factor √ó time_factor`

### Defense System

Comprehensive defense mechanics including:

- Firewall strength calculation with hardware and software factors
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS) effectiveness  
- Security rating based on weighted components
- Real-time attack analysis and response

```rust
// Example: Defense system analysis
let firewall_strength = engine.defense().calculate_firewall_strength(&hardware, &software, config_quality, update_level)?;
let ids_effectiveness = engine.defense().calculate_ids_effectiveness(&hardware, &ids_software, &topology, signature_age)?;
let security_rating = engine.defense().calculate_security_rating(&firewall, &ids, &antivirus, &log_analysis, physical_security)?;
```

### Experience System

Advanced progression system featuring:

- Logarithmic experience scaling with diminishing returns
- Skill synergy bonuses between related skills
- Mastery tiers with performance bonuses
- Learning efficiency based on practice and specialization

```rust
// Example: Skill progression
let progression = engine.experience().calculate_skill_progression(current_skill, base_exp, practice_bonus, difficulty_multiplier)?;
let efficiency = engine.experience().calculate_learning_efficiency(skill, &practice_sessions, specialization)?;
let mastery = engine.experience().calculate_skill_mastery(skill, time_invested, successful_applications)?;
```

### Financial System

Complete economic modeling including:

- Compound interest calculations for banking
- Dynamic transaction fees with caps
- Market price calculations based on supply/demand
- Cryptocurrency mechanics with mining rewards

```rust
// Example: Financial calculations
let interest = engine.financial().calculate_interest(principal, periods)?;
let fee = engine.financial().calculate_transaction_fee(amount)?;
let market_price = engine.financial().calculate_market_price(base_price, supply, demand)?;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

The engine supports comprehensive configuration for game balance tuning:

```rust
// Custom configuration example
let mut config = config::GameConfig::default();

// Adjust hacking balance
config.hacking.base_success_rate = 0.35;
config.hacking.skill_multiplier = 0.015;

// Adjust experience scaling  
config.experience.exp_scaling_factor = 1.15;
config.experience.max_skill_level = 120;

// Adjust financial parameters
config.financial.bank_interest_rate = 0.002;
config.financial.market_dynamics.volatility_factor = 0.08;

let engine = GameMechanicsEngine::with_config(Arc::new(config))?;
```

Configuration can be loaded from files or environment variables:

```rust
// From file
let config = config::GameConfig::from_file("game_config.toml")?;

// From environment
let config = config::GameConfig::from_env()?;
```

## üßÆ Mathematical Formulas

### Core Algorithms

The engine implements mathematically accurate formulas for all game mechanics:

#### Success Probability
```
P(success) = base_rate √ó (1 + skill_bonus) √ó difficulty_modifier √ó equipment_bonus √ó luck_factor
```

#### Experience Required  
```
EXP(level) = base_exp √ó (level^scaling_factor) √ó difficulty_multiplier
```

#### Process Time
```
Time = base_time √ó complexity / (resource_efficiency + 1)
```

#### Combat Damage
```  
Damage = base_damage √ó (attacker_skill / defender_skill) √ó equipment_ratio √ó random_variance
```

#### Market Price
```
Price = base_price √ó (demand/supply)^elasticity √ó volatility_factor
```

All formulas include proper bounds checking, overflow protection, and validation.

## üéÆ Game Balance

The mechanics engine maintains careful game balance through:

### Balance Principles

1. **Diminishing Returns**: Higher levels require exponentially more effort
2. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: No single strategy dominates all scenarios  
3. **Meaningful Choices**: All options have viable use cases
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Challenges scale appropriately with player skill
5. **Economic Stability**: Inflation control and money flow regulation

### Balance Tools

- **Soft Caps**: Prevent extreme min/maxing
- **Scaling Factors**: Adjust progression curves
- **Randomization**: Reduce predictability
- **Feedback Loops**: Self-correcting mechanisms
- **Configuration**: Runtime balance adjustments

    progression.old_skill_level.value(),
    progression.new_skill_level.value()
);
```
