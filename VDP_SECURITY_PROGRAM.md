# üõ°Ô∏è HackerExperience Security Program

## Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) Implementation

We've integrated a comprehensive Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) and White Hat Hall of Fame into HackerExperience, providing a safe haven for security researchers acting in good faith.

## Features

### 1. VDP Page (`/vdp`)
A dedicated page explaining our security research policy with:
- **Safe Harbor provisions** - Protection for good-faith research
- **Clear guidelines** - What's allowed, restricted, and forbidden
- **Responsible disclosure process** - How to report vulnerabilities
- **Response commitments** - 72-hour acknowledgment guarantee

### 2. Hall of Fame (`/hall-of-fame`)
Public recognition for responsible security researchers featuring:
- **Researcher credits** - Display names/aliases of contributors
- **Vulnerability descriptions** - What was found and fixed
- **Severity ratings** - Critical, High, Medium, Low classifications
- **Security statistics** - Total vulnerabilities fixed, response times

### 3. Security.txt (`/.well-known/security.txt`)
Machine-readable security policy following RFC 9116:
```
Contact: mailto:security@hackerexperience.com
Policy: https://hackerexperience.com/vdp
Acknowledgments: https://hackerexperience.com/hall-of-fame
Preferred-Languages: en
Canonical: https://hackerexperience.com/.well-known/security.txt
Expires: 2026-12-31T23:59:59Z
```

## Design Theme

**Black + Lime Safe Haven**
- Background: `#0b0b0b` (Deep black)
- Primary: `#39ff14` (Electric lime)
- Accent: `#8dff6a` (Soft lime)
- Text: `#e6ffe6` (Light green)
- Creates a hacker-friendly aesthetic while emphasizing safety

## Key Security Policies

### ‚úÖ Allowed Testing
- Security testing on test accounts
- Minimal proof-of-concept demonstrations
- Local reproduction with screenshots
- Responsible vulnerability disclosure
- Rate-limited automated scanning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Restricted (Minimal PoC Only)
- **DoS Testing**: Limited to smallest traffic needed to prove impact
- Must stop immediately after verification
- No sustained or repeated load testing
- Resource exhaustion tests require minimal demonstration

### ‚ùå Forbidden
- Data theft or exfiltration
- Accessing real player accounts
- Sustained service disruption
- Social engineering of staff/players
- Physical attacks on infrastructure
- Selling or publicizing vulnerabilities

## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Leptos SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with lime/black theme
- **Security**: Safe harbor provisions and clear guidelines
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with main API

### File Structure
```
crates/he-vdp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml           # Crate configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs          # VDP implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vdp.css         # Theme styling
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /vdp` - Vulnerability Disclosure Program page
- `GET /hall-of-fame` - Security researcher recognition
- `GET /.well-known/security.txt` - Machine-readable policy

## Reporting Process

### How Researchers Report
1. Email to `security@hackerexperience.com`
2. Include:
   - Clear vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Proof of concept (screenshots/logs)
   - Impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (optional)

### Our Response Timeline
- **Initial acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours
- **Triage and validation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix deployment**: Based on severity
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is verified

## Safe Harbor Commitment

Activities performed in accordance with our VDP are considered **authorized**:
- No legal action for compliant research
- No account bans for good-faith testing
- Collaboration to understand and fix issues
- Public recognition in Hall of Fame (opt-in)

## Security Scope

### In Scope
- Main game servers (hackerexperience.com)
- API endpoints (/api/*)
- WebSocket connections
- Authentication systems
- Game mechanics (process manipulation, PvP, economy)
- Client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, WASM)

### Out of Scope
- Third-party services
- Social media accounts
- Physical security
- Social engineering

## Integration with Production

The VDP is fully integrated into the production deployment:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Included in Docker containers
2. **Load Balancer Ready**: Nginx configuration includes VDP routes
3. **Monitoring**: Security report metrics tracked
4. **Database Ready**: Hall of Fame entries can be stored in PostgreSQL

## Benefits

### For the Game
- **Improved Security**: Community-driven vulnerability discovery
- **Trust Building**: Transparent security practices
- **Reduced Risk**: Issues found before exploitation
- **Compliance**: Follows industry best practices

### For Researchers
- **Legal Protection**: Safe harbor for testing
- **Recognition**: Public credit for contributions
- **Clear Guidelines**: No ambiguity about allowed testing
- **Fast Response**: 72-hour acknowledgment commitment

## Deployment

The VDP is automatically deployed with the main application:

```bash
# VDP routes are included in the main API server
cargo run --bin he-api

# Access points:
# http://localhost:3000/vdp
# http://localhost:3000/hall-of-fame
# http://localhost:3000/.well-known/security.txt
```

## Customization

To customize the VDP for your deployment:

1. Update contact email in `crates/he-vdp/src/lib.rs`
2. Modify security policies as needed
3. Adjust theme colors in `assets/vdp.css`
4. Add real Hall of Fame entries from database

## Compliance

This VDP implementation follows:
- **ISO 29147**: Vulnerability disclosure guidelines
- **RFC 9116**: security.txt standard
- **NIST guidelines**: Coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- **Industry best practices**: Safe harbor provisions

**The VDP provides a professional, secure channel for vulnerability reporting while building trust with the security community. It's a critical component for any production game handling user data and virtual assets.**
