# Test Improvement Plan

Generated on: Wed Sep 17 04:44:07 EDT 2025

## Current Coverage
- Total Tests: 520
- Source Files: 296
- Coverage: ~175%

## Priority Actions
1. Add tests to authentication module (security critical)
2. Test game mechanics calculations
3. Verify database queries
4. Test WebSocket events
5. Add integration tests for API endpoints

## Test Writing Guidelines
- Each public function should have at least one test
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use property-based testing for calculations
- Mock external dependencies
- Test async functions with tokio::test

## Next Steps
1. Run: cargo test --all
2. Add missing tests to priority modules
3. Run: cargo tarpaulin for coverage report
4. Aim for 80% coverage minimum
